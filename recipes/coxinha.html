        <h3>
            Breading:
        </h3>
        
        <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
            
        <li>1 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
            
        <li>oil for frying</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            Directions
            
            <li>Combine chicken breasts and 1 cup chicken broth in a pot over medium heat.<br>
                Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer until chicken is cooked through, 20 to 30 minutes.<br> 
                Keep checking that there is enough liquid in the pot and add more broth if necessary.<br>
                Remove chicken from pot, allow to cool briefly, and shred with 2 forks.</li>
            
            <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.<br>
                Add shredded chicken, olives, and parsley. Stir well and season with salt and pepper.<br>
                Remove filling from heat and set aside.</li>
            
            <li>Heat 2 cups chicken broth and butter in a large saucepan over medium heat;<br>
                season with salt and bring to a simmer. Add flour all at once and stir to form a thick paste.<br>
                Stir vigorously until mixture is smooth and no longer sticks to the bottom of the pan.<br>
                Remove from heat and let pastry cool.</li>
            
            <li>Once pastry is cool enough to handle, transfer to an oiled work surface and knead until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes.<br></li>
            
            <li>Take a portion of pastry and roll into a golf ball-sized ball.<br>
                Stick an oiled finger into the center of the ball and press edges to create a small bowl.<br> 
                Stuff with 2 teaspoons chicken filling and gather top edges to seal, rolling into a teardrop shape.<br> 
                Set croquette aside and cover with a damp towel. Repeat with remaining pastry and filling.</li>
            
            <li>Set out 3 bowls in the following order: flour, beaten eggs, bread crumbs.<br> 
                Roll each croquette in flour, then dip in egg, then cover in breadcrumbs.</li>
            
            <li>Heat oil for frying in a large saucepan or deep fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).<br> 
                Fry croquettes in batches, until golden brown on all sides, 7 to 10 minutes.<br> 
                Remove from oil and drain on paper towels.</li>
        </ol>
