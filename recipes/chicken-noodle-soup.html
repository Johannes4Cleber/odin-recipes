        Chicken Noodle Soup Ingredients:
        </strong></h3>
            
        <ul>
        <li>
        Onions and Celery: In the first step of this chicken noodle soup recipe,<br>
        diced onions and chopped celery are cooked in butter until they're aromatic and tender.
        </li>
            
        <li>Broth: This chicken noodle soup recipe calls for a mixture of chicken and vegetable broths.<br>
            If you're short on time or ingredients, you can just use one or the other.</li>
            
        <li>Chicken: Of course, you'll need chicken. If you have leftover rotisserie chicken,<br>
            you can use that in place of the cooked chicken breasts for a budget-friendly shortcut.</li>
            
        <li>Noodles: Make sure you don't add the noodles too early, as cooking them too long will make them mushy.</li>
            
        <li>Carrots: Carrots, which add a pop of bright color and flavor, are added at the end of cooking so they stay crisp.<br>
            You can add them to the saut√©ed vegetables at the beginning if you like your carrots tender.</li>
        
            <li>Basil and Oregano: Dried basil and oregano lend warm, earthy flavor to this chicken noodle soup recipe.</li>
        </ul>
