       <h3>Directions</h3>

        <ol>     
        <li>Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            
        <li>Bring the water to a boil in a saucepan. Stir in the butter and salt until the butter has melted;<br>
        remove the saucepan from the heat. Stir in the flour until no dry lumps remain;
        <br>stir in the eggs, one at a time, adding the next egg only after the last one has been completely incorporated into the mixture.<br>
        Drop the profiterole paste onto the prepared baking sheet in evenly spaced dollops.</li>
            
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the pastries have puffed up and turned golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.<br>
        Remove from the baking sheet and cool on a wire rack to room temperature.</li>

        <li>Beat 1 cup of heavy cream to soft peaks; stir in the confectioners' sugar and rosewater until the sugar has dissolved.<br>
        Bring the remaining cup of heavy cream to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat.<br>
        Remove from the heat and stir in the chocolate until melted and smooth.</li>

        <li>To assemble, poke a hole into the bottom of each pastry and fill with the rose water cream.<br>
        Place the filled profiteroles onto individual serving plates and top with the warm sauce.<br>
        Leftover profiteroles may be stored sealed in an airtight container in the refrigerator up to 5 days.</li>
        </ol>
